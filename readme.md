# Localgov

Localgov is built using [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)

Functional css for humans.

Quickly build and design new UI without writing css.

## Principles

* Everything should be 100% responsive
* Everything should be readable on any device
* Everything should be as fast as possible
* Designing in the browser should be easy
* It should be easy to change any interface or part of an interface without breaking any existing interfaces
* Doing one thing extremely well promotes reusability and reduces repetition
* Documentation helps promote reusability and shared knowledge
* Css shouldn't impede accessibility or the default functionality of Html
* You should send the smallest possible amount of code to the user
